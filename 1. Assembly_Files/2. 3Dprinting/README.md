Tips:
* PLA tends to deform in the incubator at 37Â°C. Pieces 3D printed with ASA worked much better.
* 3D printing the parts vertically avoid bent parts.
* New files were added for 3D printing :
    * To replace adapter_96w_384w.stl:
        * magnetic_adapter_96w_384w.stl;
        * magnetic_rail.stl (to print X2);
        * Note : the magnets used are N35 magnets, diam = 5 mm, h = 2 mm. Ref : https://www.conrad.fr/p/aimant-permanent-rond-n35-124-t-temperature-limite-max-80-c-conrad-components-505785-1572112.  
        M2 screws and nuts were used to attach the magnetic rails to the Optoplate.
    * standoff.stl
        * Note that this part was designed according to our neds.
